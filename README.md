Quiz-app (Practice Project)
This project was developed by me while practicing JavaScript during the Botostart JavaScript course (taught by Milad Azami).

I wrote this code myself while following along with the course to strengthen my skills.
The goal of sharing it here is to showcase my learning progress and build my portfolio.

This repository only includes the code I typed and practiced myself.
